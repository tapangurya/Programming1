For an Ecommerce application we need to write a logic to calculate the total price of the purchase after applying the discount.The discount are as follows,
If the customer is a teenager, flat discount 5%. If the total purchase price is above 5000 after the flat discount customer gets additional 5% discount.
If the customer is in 20's flat discount 6%. If the total purchase price is above 4000 after the flat discount customer gets additional 6% discount.
If the customer is aged above 29 flat discount 15%. 
Assume the age and total purchase price is given as input.
Write a program to calculate the total price of purchase after discount and display, 
total price before discount,total price after discount,discounted amount if any.
